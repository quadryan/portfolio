# How to Add Your NUS Logos

## Quick Instructions

The portfolio currently has placeholder boxes for 3 logos in the header:
1. NUS Logo
2. NUS Computing Logo  
3. NUS Overseas Colleges (NOC) Logo

## Steps to Replace Placeholders:

### Option 1: Simple Find & Replace (Easiest)
1. Open `index.html` in any text editor (Notepad, VS Code, etc.)
2. Search for: `<div class="placeholder-logo">NUS Logo</div>`
3. Replace with: `<img src="nus_logo.png" alt="NUS Logo" class="uni-logo">`
4. Search for: `<div class="placeholder-logo">NUS Computing Logo</div>`
5. Replace with: `<img src="nus_computing_logo.png" alt="NUS Computing" class="uni-logo">`
6. Search for: `<div class="placeholder-logo">NOC Logo</div>`
7. Replace with: `<img src="noc_logo.png" alt="NOC" class="uni-logo">`
8. Save the file

### Option 2: I Can Do It For You
Just upload the 3 logo files and I'll update the HTML for you!

## File Naming:
Make sure your logo files are named:
- `nus_logo.png`
- `nus_computing_logo.png`
- `noc_logo.png`

And place them in the same folder as index.html.
